			<p>Werewolves are legendary creatures with the ability to transform from a human into a wolf or a hybrid form that is part human and part wolf.

Werewolves are known for their immense strength, agility, and heightened senses, making them formidable opponents in battle. They also have a powerful healing ability, allowing them to recover from wounds more quickly than humans.

However, with proper training, werewolves can learn to control their transformations and maintain their human form during the full moon. It is believed that Werewolves are created through a bite or scratch from another werewolf, although the exact process is shrouded in mystery. They are often depicted in folklore as cursed individuals, doomed to live a life of misery and solitude due to their transformation. However settings, Werewolves may be able to embrace their dual nature and even use their abilities for good.</p>

			<h2 id="zombies">Zombie</h2>
			<img src="creatures/zombie.png" alt="Zombie" class="container2">
			<p>Zombies are undead creatures that have risen from the dead due to a mysterious and dark magic. They are characterized by their pale, lifeless skin, sunken eyes, and the unmistakable stench of decay that surrounds them. Unlike other undead creatures, zombies can only be destroyed by destroying their brains, which is often easier said than done. Zombies are known to be highly infectious and can spread their curse to others through a bite. Once bitten, a person will slowly become more zombie-like until they are fully turned. The only known cure for the zombie curse is powerful magic, but it is a difficult and often dangerous process that few have ever attempted. Zombies are relentless hunters, with an insatiable hunger for flesh. They are slow-moving but persistent, and their strength is often underestimated. They are often found in groups, which can make them even more dangerous. Despite their undead state, zombies still retain some of their memories from their former life, and have been known to exhibit a primitive intelligence, sometimes even working together to achieve their goals. They are attracted to sound and movement, and will often swarm towards anything that catches their attention.</p>
