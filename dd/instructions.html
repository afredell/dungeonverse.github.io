		<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<p>Welcome to Dungeons and Dragons: The Trail! In this game, you will be using regular DnD rules, but with the added element of navigating a dangerous trail. As you make your way westward on the Ohterlon Trail, you will encounter a variety of challenges and obstacles, such as harsh weather conditions, treacherous terrain, and dangerous creatures. You will need to manage your resources carefully, making sure you have enough food, water, and medical supplies to make it to the next town. In addition to combat encounters and exploration, you will also need to make decisions about how to navigate the trail, such as choosing between the faster, more dangerous route or the slower, safer route. You will need to trade with merchants and complete quests to earn money and supplies, and make strategic decisions about when to rest and when to push on. Overall, your goal is to make it to the end of the trail, overcoming any obstacles and challenges that come your way. Will you be able to survive the harsh conditions of the trail and reach the western frontier? Only time will tell.<p>

			<h3> Step 5. Skill Allocation </h3>
			<p>Based on your chosen race, class, and profession, your DM will allocate 6 skill points to specific skills that align with your character's abilities. These skills reflect your character's proficiency in certain areas. Skills and a basic description can be found below</p>

		<h1>Health</h1>
			In this game there are two types of health bars to manage; trail health and combat health.

			<h3>Trail Health</h3>
			<p>rail Health represents your overall well-being and endurance during the journey along The Trail. It maxes out at 8 points.
			If your Trail Health reaches zero your character can no longer do anything and you must begin making death saving throws, which determine whether you live or die. At the start of each day, roll a ten-sided dice (d10). If the result is 4 or less, you die. If it is 5 or higher, subtract 1 from your maximum Trail Health and Trail Stamina. For every consecutive day the minimum value required for the death effect to occur increases by 1. For example if you rolled abouve a 4 on your first day, you must roll higher than a 5 on the second day to survive. To end the death effect, you must regain at least 1 Trail Health point. Note: Maximum Trail Health cannot be restored at all.</p>

			<h3>Combat Health</h3>
			<p>Combat Health represents your physical condition during combat and is determined by your race. Each race has a specific Combat Health value.
			When your Combat Health reaches zero during combat, you become incapacitated, or fall unconscious.
			Losing Combat Health also affects your Trail Health. For every 10 points of Combat Health lost at the end of combat, you lose 1 Trail Health point. Combat Health can be restored through healing spells, potions, or other means available in the game. Max combat health can also be restored if a grave injury is healed.</p>

			<p>Remember to keep track of both your Trail Health and Combat Health throughout your adventure. Trail Health represents your overall well-being on The Trail, while Combat Health is specifically used during combat encounters. Take care to manage your health wisely, heal when necessary, and strategize to avoid reaching critical conditions.</p>

		<h1>Stamina</h1>
			<h3>Trail Stamina</h3>
			<p>Trail Stamina represents your physical and mental energy for traversing The Trail. It maxes out at 8 points.
			You use Trail Stamina to move tiles on The Trail, perform certain actions that are not part of a tile event, and engage in physically demanding activities. You can restore Trail Stamina through various means, such as resting, consuming extra food rations, or using specific abilities or items.</p>
			<h3>Exhaustion:</h3>
			<p>When your Trail Stamina hits zero, you become Exhausted.While Exhausted, all food ration requirements increase by 2. This means you need to consume more food to meet the daily ration needs. At the start of each day, roll a ten-sided dice (d10). If the result is 5 or less, subtract 1 from your maximum Trail Stamina.
			For every consecutive day, increase the minimum value required for the effect to occur by 1. For example, day one of exhaustion would require you to roll above a 5 to avoid a -1 to max stamina. Day two would then require rolling higher than a 6 to avoid a -1 to max stamina. To remove the Exhaustion effect, you must rest for three consecutive days without engaging in any physically demanding activities.
			Note: Maximum Trail Stamina cannot be restored once it is reduced.
			Remember to keep track of your Trail Stamina and manage it wisely. Use your stamina strategically, rest when needed, and ensure you have enough food rations to sustain your energy along The Trail. Be cautious of Exhaustion and plan your resting periods accordingly.</p>
		
		<h1>Skill Checks and Levels</h1>
			<h3>Skill Levels</h3>
			<p>Skills have a maximum value of +5 for rolls. Your skill level replaces the lowest rolled dice only if it benefits you. For example If your skill level is +5, you would replace the lowest rolled dice with a +5 instead of its original value.
			If a skill is at zero, ryou must replace the highest rolled dice with a 2.</p>

			<h3>Skill Check Rolls</h3>
			<p>For most skill checks, roll three five-sided dice (d5) and add up the results. The maximum possible roll is 15, which represents a critical success. A result of 9 or higher is considered successful.
			Results between 6 and 8 are considered a failure. A result of 5 or less is a critical failure. Note that critical failures cannot be altered by skill level.</p>
			
			<h3>Leveling Up Skills</h3>

			<p>To level up a skill, you must pass a skill check related to that skill. If your skill check result is 9 or more, roll a ten-sided dice (d10).Multiply the result of the d10 roll by the skill check result. If the product is 75 or more, your skill increases by +1. For example if you passed a skill check with a 12, you would then roll a d10. If your d10 roll is 8, you would then multiply 12 and 8 which is a 96, which would be greater than 75 meaning your skill level increases by 1. You can only attempt to level up each skill once per tile. During combat, you can only attempt to level up one skill that was used.</p>

			<p>Remember to consult with your Dungeon Master for specific skill checks and their associated skills during gameplay. Use your skills strategically and aim for successful rolls to progress and improve your character's abilities.</p>

			<h3>Special Skill Levels</h3>
			<p>Some skills at certain levels unlock different abilities<p>
			<p>Arcana<br> At Arcana level 1, you unlock Spell Slot 1. This allows you to use spells leveled 1-3. At Arcana level 3, you unlock Spell Slot 2. This allows you to use spells leveled 4-6. At Arcana level 5, you unlock Spell Slot 3. This allows you to use spells leveled 7-9. Additionally, at Arcana level 5, you have the opportunity to unlock a Mega Spell. These Mega Spells are incredibly powerful but also extremely difficult to acquire. They are one-time-use spells with immense effects. All spells are permanent and must be learned, either from spellbooks or from master magic-users.</p>

			<p>Cooking<br> At Cooking level 4, you gain the abilty to consume half the required food while traveling to a new tile. To consume less food you must roll a cooking skill check. If you role above a 10 you will only conume half the necessary food to travel a tile. This can only be used after deciding your rations, and the cooldown for this skill is 3 tiles.</p>

			<p>Religion<br> At Religion level 3, you gain the ability to pray once per tile. When you choose to pray, roll the skill check associated with Religion. Depending on the result of the roll, your prayer may be answered, granting you a beneficial effect or assistance from a divine source.</p>

			<p>These special skill levels provide unique abilities and opportunities for characters with high proficiency in Arcana, Cooking, or Religion. Remember to consult with your Dungeon Master for specific rules and limitations regarding these special abilities and to determine how they can be incorporated into your character's progression.</p>

		<h1>Traveling</h1>
			<p>In order to travel from tile to tile you must use both food and stamina.</p>

			<h3>Food Rations</h3>
			<p>No Food: If no food is consumed, the party member loses 1 stamina per day. After any 3 days without food during a section of the trail, the party member also loses 1 trail health and 2 stamina per day.<br>
			Little Food: Consuming 2 rations per person per day results in a stamina loss of 1 per day.<br>
			Normal Food: Consuming 4 rations per person per day maintains stamina levels with no net change.<br>
			Extra Food: Consuming 6 rations per person per day provides a bonus of +1 stamina per day.</p>

			<h3>Walk Speeds:</h3>
			<p>Slow: Traveling at a slow pace, the party covers 1 tile every 3 days. This incurs no stamina loss.<br>
			Moderate: Traveling at a moderate pace, the party covers 1 tile every 2 days. This results in a stamina loss of 1 per day.<br>
			Fast: Traveling at a fast pace, the party covers 1 tile every day. This results in a stamina loss of 2 per day.</p>

			<h3>Rest Days:</h3>
			<p>Normal rest Days: Every full rest day, each party member gains 2 stamina, helping to recover and recharge their energy.<br>
			Comfortable Rest Days: If the party enjoys a comfortable rest day, each member gains a greater benefit, with a total stamina gain of 4 per day.</p>


			<p>These instructions outline the effects of food rations, walk speeds, and rest days on stamina consumption and restoration during travel. Remember to keep track of the party's food supplies and adjust their stamina accordingly. The pace and availability of rest days can greatly impact the party's overall stamina levels and ability to endure the challenges of the trail.<p>

			
		<h1>Events</h1>
			<p>Events play an important role in adding excitement and unpredictability to your trail journey. There are three types of events: tile events, DM events, and river events.</p>

			<h3>Tile Events</h3>
			<p>Tile events occur at every tile as the party progresses along the trail.
			The player designated by the DM will roll a dice to determine the outcome of the event.
			The DM will provide a table or list of possible events corresponding to different dice roll results.
			Tile events can range from encounters with creatures, finding valuable resources, stumbling upon a hidden landmark, or facing challenging obstacles. The outcomes can be both positive or negative, adding suspense and variety to the trail experience.</p>
			<h3>DM Events</h3>
			<p>DM events are events that occur at the DM's discretion, typically related to the story or prior events.
			These events can serve as plot developments, character interactions, or narrative twists.
			DM events can be triggered by specific actions, choices made by the players, or as a means to advance the overall storyline.
			The DM has the creative freedom to design and introduce these events to enhance the gameplay and engage the players in the unfolding adventure.</p>
			<h3>River Events</h3>
			<p>River events occur every time the party needs to cross a river in between tiles.
			The river event adds an element of challenge and decision-making to river crossings.
			The DM will present a situation or obstacle related to crossing the river, such as a swift current, hidden rocks, or a bridge in disrepair. The players will need to strategize and make choices to navigate the river safely.
			The outcome of the river event may affect the party's trail health, combat health, or resource supplies.</p>

			<p>For all types of events, the DM should prepare a variety of event options to keep the trail experience engaging and unpredictable. The events should be balanced, providing opportunities for both triumph and setbacks, while aligning with the overall tone and story of the campaign.Remember, events are meant to enrich the gameplay and provide exciting challenges and surprises for the players. Work closely with your DM to ensure a seamless integration of events into your trail adventure.</p>
