		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>Welcome to Dungeons and Dragons: The Trail! In this game, you will embark on a perilous journey to the west, along the Ohterlon Trail. This trail is relatively new, and many dangers await you along the way. You will have to use all your skills and resources to survive and thrive as you make your way through this untamed land. As a player, you will be responsible for managing your own wagon and ensuring the safety of everyone onboard. You will make stops at towns, complete quests, interact with dangerous creatures, and make life or death decisions. You will need to use your wits, your skills, and your courage to overcome the challenges that lie ahead. Each player will have a set of unique skills that will be essential to their survival. From fishing and hunting to first aid and religion, these skills will be your tools for success. Make sure you use them wisely, and be prepared to adapt to new challenges as they arise. The journey ahead will not be easy, but with determination and skill, you might just make it to the end of the trail. So gather your party, stock up on supplies, and get ready to embark on an unforgettable adventure!</p>
