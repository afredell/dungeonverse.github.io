			<h3>Anthian</h3>
			<img src="raceimage/anthian.jpg" alt="Anthian">
			<p>Height: 5'8"-6'1"<p>
			<p>Intelligence: 3<p>
			<p>Home System: <a href="systempage/dimz.html"> Dimz </a> <p>
			<p>Home Planet: <a href="planetpage/plumo.html"> Plumo </a> <p>
			<p>Traits: The Anthians are a humanoid race that are nearly identical to humans, with one notable exception: the males have abnormally gigantic penises measuring several feet, that are always exposed and can be used as weapons in close combat. This unique adaptation has made them formidable warriors and hunters, with increased melee damage compared to other humanoid races. However, the Anthian reproduction process is also different from that of humans. Females in their species die during the reproductive process, but a fertilized egg can be placed in an artificial uterus to continue the species. Despite this limitation, the Anthians have thrived and have a rich culture and history. With their large and powerful penises, they have developed a classical culture that places great emphasis on penis-based arts, sports, and dance. In Anthian society, one's penis is seen as the most important part of their body. The size and strength of one's penis is viewed as a sign of power, and the most skilled penis fighters are highly respected in their communities. Anthians have also developed a unique style of dance that incorporates intricate peniswork and acrobatics. This dance is often performed at celebrations and festivals and is a source of great pride for the Anthian people. Their love for penis-based sports is also reflected in their competitive spirit. The most popular sport among Anthians is a game called "peenball," where two teams of players try to kick a ball into a goal while also using their penis to block and tackle opponents. Their love and reverence for their penises has even been known to influence their fashion, as most Anthian males wear open-crotched pants or no pants at all to showcase their impressive penis size and strength.</p>

They are constantly vying for power and influence, and they use their sales skills to manipulate others and climb the ranks of their own society. They have a rigid caste system, with the most successful salespeople occupying the highest positions of power and prestige.

			<h3>Cao</h3>
			<img src="raceimage/cao.jpg" alt="Cao">
			<p>Height: 5’11”-6’4”<p>
			<p>Intelligence: 2<p>
			<p>Home System: <a href="systempage/newolder.html"> Newolder </a> <p>
			<p>Home Planet: <a href="planetpage/gruslaw.html"> Gruslaw </a> <p>
			<p>Traits: The Cao were once a powerful and prosperous race, known for their exceptional physical prowess and unmatched combat skills. With their four arms and increased melee damage and action speed, they were feared and respected by many in the galaxy. But now, they stand on the brink of extinction. The Cao's downfall began when they created the Talus - robots designed to serve and protect them. But something went wrong, and the Talus turned on their creators, attacking and decimating the Cao population. Only six of them remain in the entire galaxy, struggling to survive against their own creations. Despite their dwindling numbers, the Cao have not given up. They continue to fight for their survival, using their advanced combat skills and their four arms to their advantage. They move with lightning-fast speed, striking their enemies with lethal precision. But the odds are stacked against them, and their future looks bleak. It is a tragic fate for a once-great race, now reduced to a mere handful struggling to survive on a planet overrun by their own creations.</p>

			<h3>Clanderstite</h3>
			<img src="raceimage/clanderstite.jpg" alt="Clanderstite">
			<p>Height: 4’6”-5’2”<p>
			<p>Intelligence: 2<p>
			<p>Home System: <a href="systempage/hax.html"> Hax </a> <p>
			<p>Home Planet: <a href="planetpage/elihax.html"> Elihax </a> <p>
			<p>Traits: The Clanderstite are a unique race, known throughout the galaxy for their incredible building skills. They possess an unparalleled ability to construct structures of all kinds at lightning-fast speeds, making them the go-to choice for any construction project in need of speed and efficiency. Their increased speed, strength, and carrying capacity make them ideal for heavy lifting and manual labor. They can carry and move heavy loads with ease, and their quick building skills are unmatched. It's not uncommon for a group of Clanderstites to construct a large building in a matter of days, a feat that would take other races potentially years. However, their unique abilities come at a cost. The Clanderstite have decreased intelligence and health, which can make them vulnerable in certain situations. They rely on their physical abilities and instinct more than anything else, and their survival is largely dependent on their strength and agility.The Clanderstite's remarkable building skills have made them highly sought after in the galaxy, but their decreased intelligence has made them easy targets for exploitation. Smarter, more cunning races have taken advantage of their unique abilities, using them for their own gain and often paying them a pittance for their services. Despite their incredible speed and efficiency, the Clanderstite have not yet developed the technology to travel to other stars on their own. They are often forced to rely on other races for transportation, which can put them in a vulnerable position. Some have been known to be taken advantage of by unscrupulous traders who charge exorbitant fees for their services. As a result of their exploitation, the Clanderstite often live in poverty and struggle to make ends meet. They are forced to work long hours for little pay, with little hope of improving their situation. Their unique abilities have become a curse, trapping them in a cycle of poverty and exploitation. Despite these challenges, the Clanderstite remain proud of their building skills and the legacy they have created. They continue to work hard, hoping that one day they will be able to break free from the cycle of exploitation and make a better life for themselves. They know that they are capable of great things, but they also know that they need help from other races to achieve their goals.</p>

			<h3>Dondarian</h3>

			<p>Height: 5’9”-6’3”<p>
			<p>Intelligence: 3<p>
			<p>Home System: <a href="systempage/whicax.html"> Whicax </a> <p>
			<p>Home Planet: <a href="planetpage/sambranna.html"> Sambranna </a> <p>
			<p>Traits: The Dondarians are widely regarded as the most intelligent race in the star cluster. Their impressive intellect allows them to solve complex problems and develop advanced technologies far beyond what other races are capable of. Additionally, they possess the unique ability to levitate for short periods of time, giving them a significant advantage in many situations. Despite their increased stamina, the Dondarians have a decreased carrying capacity, making them less suited to heavy lifting or manual labor. However, this is rarely an issue as their advanced technology has rendered such tasks largely unnecessary. While generally considered a good race, the Dondarians can sometimes be careless, especially when they become overly focused on a particular project or goal. This can lead to unintended consequences, but their advanced intellect often allows them to quickly course-correct and make amends. The Dondarians tend to view races incapable of star travel as primitive and lacking in intellectual capacity. They have little patience for those they see as less advanced, but they are not malicious in their views and often try to help less advanced races improve their technology and capabilities. The Dondarians are well-suited to desert climates, and their tribal culture reflects this. They are minimalist in their approach to life, often eschewing material possessions and focusing instead on intellectual pursuits. They can be cynical at times, but their impressive intellect allows them to see through many of the illusions and deceptions that other races fall prey to. Overall, the Dondarians are a unique and fascinating race, with a wealth of knowledge and capabilities that set them apart from all others in the galaxy.</p>

			<p>Home Planet: <a href="planetpage/phumite.html"> Phumite </a> <p>
			<p>Traits: The Drifti are a small lizard race that is considered to be very primitive by galactic standards. Despite their lack of technological advancement, they possess a unique characteristic that sets them apart from other races: their blood is oil-based, which gives it a distinct texture and color. The Drifti are known to be a cannibalistic race, often preying on their own kind to survive. This has led to a reputation for being ruthless and dangerous, and many other races avoid them altogether. Despite their aggressive tendencies, the Drifti possess a unique set of skills that make them formidable in their own way. They are masters of stealth and can move quickly and quietly, even in the most challenging environments. However, their combat skills are lacking, and they are generally not considered to be a significant threat in direct confrontations. The Drifti tend to live in small communities, and their social structures are simple and hierarchical. They are fiercely territorial and will defend their land and resources with great ferocity.

			<p>Home Planet: <a href="planetpage/glankear.html"> Glankear </a> <p>
			<p>Traits: The Fiitchiis are a primitive race that has not yet developed advanced technologies, and live in simple rock huts. Despite their lack of technological advancement, they possess a unique and highly prized trait that has drawn the attention of many other races: a red sac located between their legs that ejects waste in the form of gold nuggets. This has led to the Fiitchiis being exploited by other races, who seek to extract the valuable gold from their waste. As a result, the Fiitchiis have become wary of outsiders and are often hostile to visitors. In addition to their valuable waste, the Fiitchiis possess another unique ability: they can become invisible for short periods of time, making them highly effective at stealth operations. However, their physical strength and combat abilities are limited, and they are generally not considered to be a significant threat in direct confrontations. The Fiitchiis are a highly territorial race and fiercely defend their lands and resources from outsiders. They live in small communities and their social structures are simple and hierarchical. While they may be considered primitive by many, the Fiitchiis have a rich culture and history that is highly valued by their own people.</p>

Despite their impressive abilities, the Giglium are generally very calm and even-tempered. It takes a great deal to anger them, and they are generally quite peaceful and non-violent. However, when they do become angry, they can be incredibly dangerous, as their gaseous form makes them difficult to contain or control. One downside of the Giglium's unique biology is that they can be toxic to some other races. Because of the composition of their gases, some other races may find them difficult to breathe or even poisonous. As a result, the Giglium are often treated with caution and some suspicion by other races. Their charismatic personality is what truly sets them apart.

			<p>Home Planet: <a href="planetpage/drivign.html"> Drivign </a> <p>
			<p>Traits: Glob are a unique race in the star cluster, being a sentient blob without any distinguishable features or appendages. They have decreased everything, including intelligence, strength, speed, and even their ability to communicate effectively. Their lack of a traditional form or body makes them particularly difficult to interact with, as they lack the ability to manipulate tools or objects. This has led to a somewhat isolated existence for the Glob, as they struggle to interact with other races on a meaningful level. Despite their limitations, Glob possess a certain charm that has endeared them to some races. They have a gentle and unassuming presence, and their lack of any physical threat makes them a non-threatening presence in many situations. Overall, the Glob may be limited in their abilities and physical form, but they are a unique and intriguing race nonetheless.

They are also mostly isolated, and are incapable of leaving their star, making them a rare and mysterious sight in the galaxy.
